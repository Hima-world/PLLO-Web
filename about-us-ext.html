            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presidential Legislative Liaison Office 
            (PLLO) was created by virtue 
            of Memorandum Order No. 128 dated 11 November 1987, as amended by Memorandum 
            Order No. 142 dated 17 December 1987 during the term of President Corazon C. 
            Aquino. The latter issuance made effective Memorandum Order No. 128 on 1 July 1987.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Administration of former President 
            Fidel V. Ramos, several pronouncements 
            were issued that further strengthened the existence of PLLO and compelled a departure 
            from its traditional mould. In particular, during the first plenary conference of the 
            President with the newly elected Senators and Congressmen, attended by Members of the 
            Cabinet held at Malacañang Manila on 22 July 1992, the President formally announced that 
            the PLLO is the agency under the Office of the President that will liaise with Congress 
            regarding all matters impinging on Executive-Legislative relations. . Moreover, in the 
            regular Cabinet Meeting on 28 July 1992, the President gave one of the most significant 
            guiding statements when he announced that the PLLO is the agency under the Office of the 
            President tasked to officially orchestrate the formulation and the shepherding of the 
            President’s Legislative Agenda and all other concerns of the Executive Department having 
            to do with the legislature. This statement, therefore, effectively affirmed the stewardship 
            role of the PLLO over the Legislative Liaison System (LLS), which it had been assuming since 
            the creation of the LLS in 1988 pursuant to Cabinet Resolution No. 16.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Head of the PLLO was appointed 
            as Member of the World Trade Organization 
            Advisory and ASEAN Free Trade Advisory Commissions by virtue of Executive Order No. 193 dated 
            2 August 1994. The PLLO was also included in the membership of the Social Reform Agenda (SRA) 
            Council through Executive Order No. 228 of President Ramos dated 6 March 1995 in order “to ensure 
            immediate and continuing action on the legislative agenda of the SRA.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Estrada Administration, one of President 
            Joseph Estrada’s first official acts was the 
            issuance of Memorandum Order No. 3 dated 3 July 1998, merging the Legislative Affairs Office (LAO) 
            and the PLLO under the administrative and operational jurisdiction of the PLLO headed by the 
            Presidential Adviser on Legislative Affairs, with the rank of Secretary and assisted by two (2) 
            Deputies, one for each Chamber of Congress, with the rank of Undersecretary. With the change, the 
            PLLO assumed the responsibilities of bill drafting, inter-agency consultations, preparation of 
            presidential certification of the urgency of priority bills, the ceremonial signing thereof, up to 
            the furnishing of new enactments to the concerned agencies and the Malacañang Records Office also for 
            publication.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above functional and structural relationship was 
            sustained under the Macapagal-Arroyo Administration. 
            And the growing reliance on the PLLO and recognition of its strategic significance within the whole 
            bureaucracy was further affirmed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in two separate meetings of the 
            Cabinet. On 13 March 2001, Her Excellency designated the PLLO as the Cabinet liaison to represent individual 
            executive offices in the Commission on Elections on matters relating to the 14 May 2001 elections. On 02 
            July 2001, the President designated the PLLO as overall in-charge of the substantive and administrative 
            preparations for the State of the Nation Address (SONA) of the President.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Legislative Secretariat in the Office of the 
            President was abolished by virtue of Executive 
            Order 344, entitled “Creating the Office of the Political Adviser in the Office of the President, Defining 
            its Mandate and Responsibilities, and Creating the Office of Political Coalition Affairs and the Office for 
            Constituency Affairs,” dated 09 August 2004 The Legislative Secretariat’s functions, duties and responsibilities 
            were transferred to the PLLO which together with the Office of Political Coalition Affairs, and the Office for 
            Constituency Affairs were placed under the oversight of the Office of the Political Adviser. Since then,the 
            Presidential Political Adviser along with the Head of PLLO had attended and participated in regular Cabinet 
            meetings and had been actively involved in Inter-Agency Task Forces and Cabinet Clusters such as those involving 
            National Security Council (NSC), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the National Anti-Poverty 
            Commission (NAPC), among others.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the implementation of the rationalization program of the Office of the President, the functions, duties 
            and responsibilities absorbed by the PLLO from the Legislative Affairs Office were reverted to the Legislative 
            Office under the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs (ODESLA).
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 09 March 2010, President Macapagal-Arroyo through Executive Order No. 866, placed the PLLO under the supervision 
            of the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Special Concerns.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost one year into the Aquino Administration, a major reorganization of the cabinet cluster system was implemented 
            through Executive Order No. 43 (s. 2011), wherein the PLLO was named as a member of the cluster on Good Governance 
            and Anti-Corruption with the mandate of promoting transparency, accountability, participatory governance and 
            strengthening of public institutions. This cluster, together with the other four cabinet clusters created under 
            said executive order, namely: Human Development and Poverty Reduction; Economic Development; Security, Justice and 
            Peace; and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, serve as the primary mechanism of the Executive Branch for 
            directing all efforts towards the realization of the Social Contract with the Filipino People.
